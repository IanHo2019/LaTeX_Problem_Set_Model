# LaTeX Coding for Producing Solutions to a Problem Set
In this repository, I share my LaTeX coding for producing a pdf file with solutions to a problem set in Economics. Using my coding, you can
  * construct a short table;
  * construct a picture (e.g., game tree and plot of a function) by `tikz`;
  * customize some mathematical operators/symbols;
  * customize shaded frames for solutions;
  * insert external coding (e.g., Stata, MATLAB, R, etc.);
  * construct in-text citations and a reference list.
